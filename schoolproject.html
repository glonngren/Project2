        I am currently involved in a project that will see a new WiFi network installed
        into a building that is under renovation and is to serve as a food pantry, retreat center,
        volunteer living space and resource center for local families in Humbolt Park.
        Currently we are raising funds to purchase required equipment. If you would like to
        participate in this project or donate to the cause, please contact me at
        glonngren@hawk.iit.edu.
